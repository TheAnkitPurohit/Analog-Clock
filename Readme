1. Hour Caculation 

12 hr = 360 Degree
  1 hr = 360/12 Degree  = 30 Degree

  and   

  60 min = 30 Degree
  1  min = 1/2 Degree
  m  min = m/2 Degree

  For h hour = 30h + m/2


2. Minute Calculation

60 min = 360 Degree
1 min  = 6 Degree
m  min = 6 Degree


3. Second Calculation

60 sec = 360 Degree
1 sec  = 6 Degree
s  sec  = 6 Degree
